Arduino code: LED Shirt 6x6 matrix
----------------------------------
Author: Varun Madahar

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a project I worked on using Arduino Uno and then finally on a
Lilypad to create a 6x6 LED matrix.  This work was done for a friend of
mine on his wedding.  The code is written to work with the Arduino SDK
and works with Arduino Uno or Lilypad.  I have provided enough information
to port this code over to any Arduino based boards.

I used basic NPN transistors on each column and row for the LED's and had
a separate 9V battery powering the LEDs and another AAA battery powering
the Lilypad.  Since this entire project was done on a shirt I used conductive
thread to stich the entire shirt and used a small bread board for actually
putting the LED's in a 6x6 matrix.

I will provide pictures of the finished product later on and also a list of
all the hardware used to build the shirt.
